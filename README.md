<h2><strong>What is "It's Burger Time!"</strong></h2>
  * This is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.<br>
  * Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.<br>
  * Each burger in the "Burgers Available to be Eaten" section also has a `Devour it!` button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page in the "Burgers That Have Been Eaten".<br>
* The app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.<br>
* The differnce between this app and the original is that this app was built using Sequelize instead of vanilla Mysql.
